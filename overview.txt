    nlscaling
    
    Python 2.7 code for the estimation of error variances of soil moisture products that are possibly nonlinearly related
    
    The estimation is based on the triple collocation technique and extensions thereof, which are all applied in testScnearios/testEstimation.py
    Additionaly, approximate inference methods (e.g. Markov Chain Monte Carlo, variational methods, etc.) for the probabilistic model underlying the variational EM algorithm for error estimation are implemented; these are all compared in testScenarios/testApproximateInference.py
